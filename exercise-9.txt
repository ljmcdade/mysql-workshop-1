Barn with Chickens:
# of roosters
# of hens
# of chicks
chicks coming of age date

columns:

date hatched (where you're starting from)
gender m/f (gives hens vs roosters)
chickComingOfAge (tells you whether chick or grown at any given time)
processing date (tells you whether they're still alive -- so sad for this vegetarian)
